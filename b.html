    <p class="bb">What is the Quran?
        The most conventional answer is that the Quran is a book – but it is not like most books. It is made up of words
        which contain truth and guidance for every human being, and Muslims believe that these are words revealed
        directly by God, in the Arabic language, to the last of His prophets and messengers, Muhammad ﷺ (peace be upon
        him).
        The Quran presents itself with a number of names and descriptions which are worth reflecting on. Here are just a
        few:
        Quran and Kitab (Recital & Writ): the first means something recited aloud, and the second means something
        written down. This describes the two main ways this scripture is experienced, and which you can encounter on
        this website.
        Kalam Allah (Divine Speech): this means that these words are a direct communication from the Creator and Master
        of every living being. It occupies the highest level of authority for its believers, and it is clarified and
        supported by the teachings of the Prophet ﷺ. While the language of this particular revelation was Arabic, we
        also have many translations into different languages which help us to understand its meanings.
        Dhikr and Huda (Remembrance & Guidance): the Quran is used as a way to connect with God and keep Him in our
        hearts and on our tongues. It is also fundamentally a guide for our personal lives and for the life of the
        community and society.
        The Quran is the final revealed message which complements and completes earlier revealed scriptures, just as the
        Prophet Muhammad ﷺ taught the same essential message as the many prophets before him, including Adam, Noah,
        Moses, Abraham, and Jesus (peace be upon them all). The Quran clarifies what humanity needs to know from now
        until the Day of Judgment, and it will remain preserved from loss and distortion which affected previous
        scriptures in various ways.
        "˹This is˺ a blessed Book which We have revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ so that they may contemplate its verses, and
        people of reason may be mindful." 38:29
        We welcome you to Quran.com and invite you to read and listen to the Quran with an open heart, to deeply
        contemplate its verses, sincerely seek the knowledge contained within it, and to learn more using the resources
        on our site. We hope you will find Quran.com beneficial and pray that the message of the Quran will enrich your
        life’s journey.</p>
