    <h1 class="e">Makkah</h1>
    <p class="ee">Makkah is the holiest city for Muslims. It embraces Masjid Al Haram (the GreatMosque) and Kaaba, the
        qiblah for Muslims to which they turn in their prayers. Muslims yearn to visit Makkah to perform Hajj or Umrah.
        In this city, Prophet Muhammad, the most honorable of creation, the seal of the prophets and messengers, our
        master Muhammad, peace be upon him, was born, and from it, the tolerant message of Islam was launched to all
        corners of the world after the Holy Quran was revealed. Makkah is located in the western part of Saudi Arabia.
        During the reign of the kings of Saudi Arabia, it received great interest. Makkah still enjoys great attentionto
        provide the best services to pilgrims. Its most prominent landmark, Masjid Al Haram, witnessed many expansions
        that included all parts of the mosque, and the holy sites received a series of development works to provide all
        means of comfort and reassurance for all pilgrims from inside and outside the Kingdom.</p>

        <p class="ee">Makkah is the Sanctuary of Allah
        Allah singled out Makkah and honored it over all parts of the world. One of the greatest signs is that it is His
        sanctuary.
        What is the meaning of “Haram” (Sanctuary)?
        It is a place in which certain things, allowed elsewhere, are prohibited out of veneration and reverence for the
        One Who prohibited it. Allah the Exalted said: "And who observes the sanctity of the sites ordained by Allah, it
        will be good for him in the sight of his Lord.”
        Allah has chosen this land and made it sacred, forbidding in it what He permitted in other places, and singling
        it out with virtues and merits that are not found in any other place. Its sanctity and stature date back to the
        very first beginning of the entire universe.
        Allah has made this land into a Sanctity and assigned to it a very special rank on the day this universe was
        created. It will remain so until the end of time. The Prophet (blessings and peace be upon him) said: "Allah has
        made this town a sanctuary from the day</p>
